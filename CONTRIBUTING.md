# How to contribute a digital edition to the _Catalogue_

## Inclusion criteria
The project is constantly evolving as users request more features and development on the [web app](https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/dig_ed_cat) moves forward. At the moment we don't accept ebooks, any form of commercial digital books or transcriptions made available via Wikisource, but projects whose authorship can be traced back to one or multiple individuals with, if possible, an institutional affiliation (university and/or GLAM institution). We primarily look for digital editions and digital scholarly editions (by which we mean editions with a strong critical component) but people are also beginning to submit digital archives, textual collections where some texts are treated in more detail, etc. It's worth noting that people define their projects in various ways (e.g. a project may define itself as a database when it fact it might be more of a digital archive) using different terms synonymously. This makes it difficult to pick what should be included in our list or not. The line of inclusion in our catalogue is a little blurry but it reflects the fuzziness that comes with these projects.

## Updating existing entries
If you want to **suggest changes to existing editions**, please add these as issues in this repository with the name of the edition in question. You can suggest edits either via a GitHub pull-request or by telling us in the issue text field what you'd like us to change.

## Contribution options: GitHub or Google Forms
There are **three different ways to contribute a digital edition**: 

1. If you're familiar with GitHub, you know what to do: fork this repository, edit the .csv file and create a pull request. 
2. If you're not familiar with GitHub, you can create a GitHub [issue](https://github.com/gfranzini/digEds_cat/issues) with as much information about the edition as possible (see "Data fields" section below). The more information you provide, the sooner the edition will appear in the _Catalogue_.
3. If you'd rather not use GitHub at all, you can fill-in [this Google Form](https://goo.gl/forms/4Ya3jwRCBi0VSexx2). Your entry will be moderated and added to the _Catalogue_ by an administrator.

It's important you're consistent and follow these guidelines for the [web application](https://dig-ed-cat.eos.arz.oeaw.ac.at/) to display your contribution correctly.



### Data fields
The fields the _Catalogue_ uses to classify information are listed below. Some take free text, others use predefined values. 
The words "**not provided**" are used to indicate that the website or project does not provide the relevant information.
However you choose to contribute a digital edition to the _Catalogue_, please ensure you address as many of the following fields as possible.

***

#### Historical Period
This field broadly categorises the source material of a digital edition by the following periods:

* Antiquity               [700 BC - 500 AD]
* Middle Ages             [500 - 1500]
* Early Modern            [1500 - 1789]
* Long Nineteenth Century [1789 - 1914]
* Modern                  [1914 - 1965]
* Contemporary            [1965 - Today]

#### Time/Century
The specific year(s) or century of the digital edition's source material. Year ranges can also be added in the format `YYYY-YYYY`.

#### Edition name
The name of the digital edition project.

#### URL
The URL of the digital edition project.

#### Scholarly
Here the values `0` [no] or `1` [yes] should be used to say whether the edition is _scholarly_ in accordance with [Patrick Sahle](http://www.digitale-edition.de/vlet-about.html)'s definition of the term:
>An edition must be critical, must have critical components - a pure facsimile is not an edition, a digital library is not an edition.

#### Digital vs. Digitised
Here the values `0` [no] or `1` [yes] should be used to say whether the digital edition is _digital_ in accordance with [Patrick Sahle](http://www.digitale-edition.de/vlet-about.html)'s definition of the term:
>"A digitized print edition is not a "digital edition". If the paradigm of an edition is limited to the two-dimensional space of the "page" and to typographic means of information representation, then it's not a digital edition." (see: http://www.digitale-edition.de/vlet-about.html)

#### Edition
Here the values values `0` [no] or `1` [yes] should be used to say whether the digital edition is an _edition_ in accordance with [Patrick Sahle](http://www.digitale-edition.de/vlet-about.html)'s definition of the term:
>An edition must represent its material (usually as transcribed/edited text) - a catalog, an index, a descriptive database is not an edition.

#### Language
The language(s) the source material is written in [three-letter ISO Codes](http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php) are used. 

#### Writing support
The nature of the source material (manuscript, letter, notebook, etc.). Use the singular form of the tag only (e.g. "Letter" even if the edition contains multiple) and capitalise the first letter. Separate multiple source materials with a semicolon.

#### Begin date
Year the project started. If not specified, use `not provided`.

#### End date
Year the project ended. If ongoing type `present`. If not specified, use `not provided`.

#### Manager
Name and surname of principal investigator/manager/coordinator. If multiple, separate with a semicolon.

#### Participating institution(s)
Institution(s) involved in the project. If multiple, separate with a semicolon. If not specified, use `not provided`.

#### Audience

#### Value of witnesses
* `N/A`: Not applicable, as no information about the source of the text is given, though it is easily assumable that the source is another digital or printed edition (possibly even a scholarly edition).
* `0`: The only witness modelled digitally is a printed non-scholarly edition used as a source for the digital edition.
* `0.5`: Same as above, but the witness/source is a scholarly edition.
* `1`: The witnesses are traditional philological primary sources (including manuscripts, inscriptions or papyri).

#### XML-TEI transcription

#### Application Programming Interface (API)
The values `0` [no] or `1` [yes] are used to specify if the digital edition comes with an API.

#### Crowdsourcing
The values `0` [no] or `1` [yes] are used to specify if the digital edition relies/relied on crowdsourced contributions.

#### Print-friendly view
The values `0` [no] or `1` [yes] are used to specify if the digital edition provides a print-friendly view of the text (e.g. PDF) or if the browser produces a suitable, printable version of the content.

#### Print facsimile (complementary output)
The values `0` [no] or `1` [yes] are used to specify if the digital project is complemented by a printed facsimile.

#### Repository of source material
The institution(s) that house the source text(s). `N/A` is used if the source is a new edition without a physical location, and `not provided` is used to indicate that the project website does not give clear information about the source's current repository.

#### Place of origin of source material
